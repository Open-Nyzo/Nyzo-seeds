## Welcome Open Nyzo Seeds

blah blah intro


### Seed files from 000762 and up

Are in the seeds/ subdirectory

Live github pages access: WIP

### Older seeds

Older seeds, that already are included in blocks and no more needed for regular node operation can be found at https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Nyzo-past-seeds

## Alternate seed hostings

Here is a list of alternate - community operated - seed files hosting.  
We'll aim to provide checksums and tools to check them in the future, as fake seed files could be an attack vector.
